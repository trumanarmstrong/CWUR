STAT 1010 Project Dataset
Of all the universities in the world, which are the best?

Ranking universities is a difficult, political, and controversial practice. There are hundreds of different national and international university ranking systems, many of which disagree with each other. This dataset contains three global university rankings from very different places.



Section 1 - Introduction: The introduction should introduce your general research question and your data (where it came from, how it was collected, what are the cases, what are the variables, etc.).

Section 2 - Data: Place your data in the `/data` folder, and add dimensions and codebook to the README in that folder. Then print out the output of and codebook to the README in that folder. Then print out the output of glimpse() or skim() of your data frame. Add the README for the data, the codebook, and the output of glimpse() or skim() to the end of your proposal.

Section 3 - Data analysis plan:

Any outcomes (response, Y) and predictor (explanatory, X) variables you will use to answer your question.

The comparison groups you will use, if applicable.

Very preliminary exploratory data analysis, including some summary statistics and visualizations, along with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data. (You can add to these later as you work on your project.)

The method(s) that you believe will be useful in answering your question(s). (You can update these later as you work on your project.)

What results from these specific statistical methods are needed to support your hypothesized answer?
